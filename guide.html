<h4>General Information</h4>

<p>Spratz are essentially just cats with spray bottle heads.</p>

<p><i>*Note that almost all of the anatomy described here can be changed with certain traits.</i></p>

<p>Without the use of certain traits, any Spratz will have a nozzle at the front of the face, a trigger under the jaw, a collar around the neck, and a handle at the back of the head.</p>

<p>Spratz can optionally be drawn with a simple mouth where one would expect it. This is only for expressing—there is still a layer of bottle under it preventing anything from getting into the bottle.</p>

<p>The head should be entirely bottle except for a "mask" of fur that also surrounds the eyes and ears. This mask can also be drawn with patches of fur or bottle on either side. None of the mask is present on the neck or handle, and it does not touch the nozzle or trigger.</p>

<p>Everything below the collar is considered the body. The body of the Spratz must be between 20% and 80% bottle. Excess traits added to the Spratz do not count towards this percentage.</p>

<br>

<br>

<h4>Other Notes:</h4>

<p>Bottles can be matte or glossy without needing additional traits!</p>

<p>Neck height can vary somewhat. </p>

<p>Ears do not have to be cat ears, but they do need to be similar. </p>

<p>Inner ears and pawpads are made of bottle.</p>

<p>Irises must match one of the colors of the bottle unless using non-common eye traits.</p>

<br>

<hr>

<br>

<h4>Size limits:</h4>
<p>1) Ears are no longer than the distance from the edge of the nozzle to the edge of the handle.</p>

<p>2) Tails are no longer than TWICE the distance from the chest to the hindquarters.</p>

<p>3) Handles generally reach no further than half of the back.</p>

<p>All other parts are NOT unlimited without the use of certain traits, but they do not have a specific limit.</p>

<br> 

<hr>

<br>

<p>So long as these rules are followed, basic anatomy can vary!
